# Snake_Game
Created a Snake Game with Python where the user uses arrow keys to move around a snake to reach its food and avoid hitting the edge of the screen. 
This project utilizes the turtle module to create the snake as well as food objects. The time module is used to control the speed of the snake. Additionally, file writing is implemented to write the high score to a file in order to be able to store the high score across multiple different runs of the game. This project was created as part of a Udemy Course- 100 Days of Code:The Complete Python Bootcamp for 2022.
